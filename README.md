# Non-linear features & learning optimal portfolios
Given a set of stock characteristics, the problem of finding features (i.e. factors) that predict returns and optimizing a portfolio of those features in order to maximize out-of-sample performance can be expressed as a learning problem with neural network architectures. Gu et al (2018) apply neural network architectures to the task of predicting returns from stock characteristics, suggesting that non-linearities and interactions matter. However, portfolios are created downstream of their models' learning task in order to analyze the economic significance of the predictions. Brandt et al (2004) shows that directly estimating portfolio weights with stock characteristics outperforms benchmark portfolio optimization methods. However, they use linear models with a small number of pre-determined factors. This analysis aims to directly estimate portfolio weights as non-linear functions of arbitrary stock characteristics using neural network architectures trained at the portfolio optimization task.
