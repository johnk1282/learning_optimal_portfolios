# Learning-based portfolio optimization
Given a set of stock characteristics, the problem of finding features (i.e. factors) that predict returns and optimizing a portfolio of those features in order to maximize out-of-sample performance can be expressed as a learning problem with neural network architectures. The notebook summary_results.ipynb highlights some high-level results. The details can be found in process_data.py and train_models.py.
